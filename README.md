## Project Structure

This project consists of two main parts:

1. **React Frontend**: The user interface built with React, Tailwind CSS, and various libraries for barcode scanning and image recognition.
2. **Node.js Backend**: A server that provides API endpoints and maintains a MongoDB database of products.

## Setup
